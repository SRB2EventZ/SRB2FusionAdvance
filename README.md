# What is Fusion Advance?

Fusion Advance is a custom build of Sonic Robo Blast 2, Version 2.1.25, forked from P-AS's [SRB2-Legacy build](https://github.com/P-AS/srb2-legacy), which is an attempt at an unofficial patch of Version 2.1, continuing where v2.1.25 left off, including essential fixes and QOL improvements seen in Version 2.2.

This build is maintained by members of the [Super SRB2 Games Z community](https://supersrb2gamesz.github.io/), (a.k.a, 99% chromaticpipe, lol) and adds a host of new features from versions before and after Version 2.1.

# What does this build have that makes it stand out?

* ## Uncapped Framerate

  A port of the Uncapped Framerate from Version 2.2/SRB2Kart! Now you can play at your monitor's refresh rate, making for an overall smoother experience!

* ## OpenGL Shaders

    So OpenGL doesn't suck AS bad

* ## Orbital Camera

  This camera orbits around the player instead of panning, making looking around in third person way easier! Enable with the `cam_orbital` cvar in the console. (WARNING: Might look strange in software. OpenGL is preferred for this camera option.)

* ## SRB2Kart-Esque Video Options Menu (ft. opengl menu too!)

  Now it doesn't suck!
